'''
	Identifies a weight associated with each sample based on its likelihood. 
	Given p(X1) > p(Xi) for all i
	Using KDE if p(X1)/p(X2)=2  the weight for X1 = 1, and X2 = 2
	This means that if X1 is the most likely samples and if X1 is 
	2 times more likely than X2, then X1 would have a weight of 1
	and X2 would have a weight of 2.
	This weight can then be used to balance the sample importance for regression
